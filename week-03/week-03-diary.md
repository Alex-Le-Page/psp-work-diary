# Week 3 Diary - Story Points

This week, on the approach to sprint week, we started to break down the areas of the project more and categorise them into story points. We outlined the average point -
"cost" of each area after receiving contributions from each team member based on how difficult we thought each task would be.

Alongside this, we also contributed 6 hours towards meeting outside of university hours to do some work on and understand the code more in torcs, in order for us to have
a sort of head-start going into the sprint week.
