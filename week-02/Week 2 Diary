#Week 2 in Professional Software Projects

This week, we decided on our team name. Our name is "SHU-baru".

We all worked on the recipe book to familiarise our self with github. The recipe book that we all worked on this week: https://github.com/Alex-Le-Page/team-recipe-book.git

As we analysed the clients requirements for this project which we got from asking our clients questions and reading the brief, helped us outline some MSCW points. Some of out points include: Functional AI Race Bot, Race Engineer Chatbot, and Procedural commentary, each in different MSCW levels.
