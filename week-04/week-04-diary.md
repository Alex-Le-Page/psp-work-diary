# Week 4 - Risk Assessment

This week we looked at the risks that could pose an issue to our group project during sprint week. We took suggestions from the group and composed another word document
that is composed of a list of problems that we believe we could encounter during the sprint week development phase.

Alongside this we met up an additional 3 hours outside of university hours and another 2-3 hours on discord calls to discuss, work on and interpret the TORCS code.
During this time, I also begin to experiment with some post-lap analysis features for us to complete and work on during sprint week.
