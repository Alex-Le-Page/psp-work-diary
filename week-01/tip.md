# Week 1 in Professional Software Projects


This week I did the team-role-preference test (TRP) as the module leaders instructed.

The results I recieved were Researcher (71.4) and Diplomat (67.83). I believe that I align with these roles, as the researcher result is reflected through the way I try to make sure that I fully and completely understand everything that I am coding and what it and the surrounding code does. I also align with diplomat as I think that is an important and vital part of a team to be able to have efficient communication and compromisation skills between team members.

I hope to be able to effectively contribute to efficienct programming practices, providing sufficient research and reason where needed. I also plan to be able to help the team communicate between eachother smoothly and cleanly, minimising miscommunications and maximising how quickly we can tackle problems within the team.
