# Day 3 of Sprint Week

Today I made significant progress on the procedural commentary. I identified many key errors and limiting factors in my code and fixed or optimised them successfully.
I also managed to get the TTS to read the lap-analysis data from the CSV and read it out-loud. This combined with the live updates running from the JSON file and fixing
a bug that stopped the code from being able to read the JSON while it was being written to, I made significant progress today. There will be many updates to this part of the 
code to make it seem more realistic and have more accurate responses. Below are some snippets of my code that I have written today.
