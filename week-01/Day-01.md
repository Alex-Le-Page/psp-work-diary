# Day 1 - Sprint Week

On this day of sprint week I focused on post-lap analysis. I first began by taking the variables that I had created a week or so earlier and writing them to a CSV.
Then I created a new function, called calculate_braking_distance which will calculate the overall distance of the track that the car was braking for. After this, I re-wrote
the CSV file to have a more structured design when it holds data. Now the CSV will display the lap of the car that the data is for, the lap time for that lap, the overall best
lap time, the difference in time compared to the previous lap, total braking distance and acceleration distance.

Below are two attachents of my major additions to the file, however there are many small variables used to track braking, acceleration ect scattered in the code at their
appropriate locations.
